# search-rotated-sorted-array
In this program we first find a pivot value of the array depending on its nature i.e whether it has repeated or non repeated elements and then we try to find the target element's smallest occuring index.
Efficient algorithm to search for a target element in a rotated sorted array using modified binary search. Handles cases with and without duplicates, and includes test cases for validation.
